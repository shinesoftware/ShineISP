<!--@subject Domain DNS changed for [domain] @-->

Dear User,

our automatic tasks system has changed the domain dns information for [domain]. 

If you use different name servers, you can manage only the Name Server Record.
In this case the mail system will be handle by an external service and you have to have to use the external service for the mail accounts.

Changing the Nameservers is not immediate, you have to wait a minimum of 24/48 hours.

For further information please contact us via helpdesk system.

Best Regards
