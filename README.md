ShineISP
==========

The idea behind the project.
The idea for the project was born here at Shine Software headquarters. We found our customer registration process was annoying and complicated because we had to enter the same data 5 times in 5 different systems. Not to mention this process was time-consuming and a potential source of making mistakes. So we thought to build us a small and modular system in order to simplify our customers accounting tasks. It turned out to become a project which has been growing day by day ever since we started it, thanks to the help and support of a (small) community and the simple approach to the project. There are many features to be included into the first alpha release and we are excited to start the "real thing".

Why a new free web hosting customer management system?
It’s simple: We at Shine Software strongly believe in the concept of free software, open for every one to improve and adapt it to individual needs.

Cooperation.
We invite anybody who would like to cooperate with us to improve the ShineISP system. Just contact us by mail and we will answer you as soon as possible.
At the moment the software is in beta release. This means that we have been developing the various modules that will help you and your web hosting business to speed up your working processes.
