    content: "<p>FileZilla Client is a free, open source FTP client. It supports FTP, SFTP, and FTPS (FTP over SSL/TLS). The client is available under many platforms, binaries for Windows, Linux and Mac OS X are provided.</p>\r\n<h3>Connecting to a server</h3>\r\n<p>The first thing to do is connecting to a server.</p>\r\n<p>This is our (fictional) login data - please use your own data instead if you want to actively follow the tutorial.</p>\r\n<pre> Hostname: example.org\r\n Username: john\r\n Password: 7PjU#.J3\r\n</pre>\r\n<p>We will use the quickconnect bar for establishing the connection:</p>\r\n<p><a class=\"image\" href=\"http://wiki.filezilla-project.org/File:Tutorial_Quickconnect.png\"><img src=\"http://wiki.filezilla-project.org/wiki/images/d/df/Tutorial_Quickconnect.png\" alt=\"Tutorial Quickconnect.png\" width=\"677\" height=\"30\" /></a></p>\r\n<p>Enter the hostname into the quickconnect bar's <em>Host:</em> field, the username into the <em>Username:</em> field as well as the password into the <em>Password:</em> field. You may leave the <em>Port:</em> field empty unless your login information specifies a certain port to use. Now click on <em>Quickconnect</em>.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> If your login information specifies a protocol like <em>SFTP</em> or <em>FTPS</em>, enter the hostname as follows: <tt>sftp://hostname</tt> or <tt>ftps://hostname</tt> respectively.</p>\r\n<p>FileZilla will now try to connect to the server. If all works well, you will notice that the right \"column\" switched from <em>Not connected to any server</em> to displaying a list of files and directories.</p>\r\n<h3>Using the Quick Connect bar</h3>\r\n<p>To connect to an FTP server, enter the address of the server into the  host field of the Quickconnect bar (e.g. example.com - see image  below). If it is a special server type like an SFTP server, add the  protocol in front of the address. In case of an SFTP server, start the  address with 'sftp://' (e.g. sftp://example.com). Enter the port of the  server into the port field if it is <em>not</em> the default port (21 for  FTP, 22 for SFTP). If a username / password is required, enter it in the  corresponding fields, otherwise the default <em>anonymous</em> logon will be used. Click on Quickconnect or press Enter to connect to the server.</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"http://wiki.filezilla-project.org/wiki/images/1/10/Enter-info.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"695\" height=\"125\" /></p>\r\n<p>Please notice that the Quick Connect is for... quick connections - so  there is no way to edit the quick connections list which stores the  last 10 entries. To store FTP server names you should use the Site  Manager, instead.</p>\r\n<p>Quick Connect is good for testing the login info before making a  site manager entry.  Once you connect, you can choose File -&gt; \"Copy  current connection to Site Manager...\" to make a permanent entry.  It is  usually best to check your login info with Quick Connect before making a  permanent entry.</p>"
